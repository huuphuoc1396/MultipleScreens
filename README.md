## Overview
This sample is about how to display two activities on two screens at the same time. Besides, It also implements the tracking events of LG dual screens by using the SDK of LG.

## [Multi-display](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables?#using_secondary_screens)
In the future, you might see foldable phones that support more than one screen or display at a time. Handling this configuration is similar to how developers work with projected screens today on Chrome OS.

Android 10 (API level 29) and higher supports activities on secondary displays. If an activity is running on a device with multiple displays, users can move the activity from one display to another. Multi-resume applies to multi-screen scenarios as well. Several activities can receive user input at the same time.

## [LG Dual Screen SDK](http://mobile.developer.lge.com/develop/sdks/lg-dual-screen-sdk/)
The LG Dual Screen is a mobile handset with two screens. Independent applications can be run on the screens at the same time.
